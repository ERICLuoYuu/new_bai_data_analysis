## Why should you learn Python?

Generally speaking Python is a general-purpose, high-level interpreted programming language. What does that mean? 

It means that it can be used for almost any kind of application you can achieve with any programming language. The "high-level" refers so to speak to the "distance" from the hardware in the way you use the language. The most extreme other side of the spectrum would be Assembly, where you directly control the processor and memory of the PC. Python lets you speak in simple terms and the computer understands what you want. In contrast to many other languages such as Java or C you don't even have to compile your code. Compiling is a process in which your written code gets translated into something the machine can understand. In Java for example your workflow is always *write code -> compile program -> run program*. Python is interpreted which means that whenever you execute your code, it gets internally compiled and directly executed. That takes some responsibility of our shoulders.  

Not to forget: Python is one of the most widely used programming languages of all. The below graphic is from the [2023 Stackoverflow software developer survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Pythons ranking is especially impressive as the other top languages are  HTML, CSS and Javascript which power the majority of the modern internet while not being very widely used in other contexts.

The data science platform [Kaggle conducted a similar study in 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle-survey-2022){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} but specifically for data science and machine learning engineers . In the plot below you can clearly see that Python is the most widely used technology, way before R (R even decreasing in use) and SQL.
