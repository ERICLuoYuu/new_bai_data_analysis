This interactive tutorial will get you started on your data-exploration road and make you familiar with some core
concepts of Python programming and data analysis.

#### Table of Contents
1. [General stuff about Python](#1-general-stuff-about-python)
2. [Data Types and Variables](#2-data-types-and-variables)
3. [Operators](#3-operators)
4. [Functions](#4-functions)
5. [Lists, Dicts, Numpy and Pandas](#5-data-structures)
6. [Loops and Conditionals](#6-extra-loops-and-conditionals)

Notice that it is not at all expected that you learn all these things and they are burnt into your brain (!!!!!). 
It is more of a broad intrdocution to all the basics so you have hard of them, but programmers do look up stuff
all the time! So don't worry if it is a lot of input right now, just try to understand the concepts and you 
can always come back and find help in here, in the internet or from me directly.
  
Here are some useful ressources if you get stuck:

[Link: A general tutorial on several topics](https://www.tutorialkart.com/r-tutorial/)

[Link: A comprehensive list of built-in functions](https://www.javatpoint.com/r-built-in-functions)

and last but not least, if you need help with a specific function (we will talk about functions later), you can 
use the nice inbuilt method help(). For example you can run help(paste) and will directly see the documentation
for that function

## 1. General stuff about Python
I quickly want to highlight some things which are special about Python compared to many other programming languages and that one needs to get used to.
